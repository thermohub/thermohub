Critically evaluated experimental data on mineral solubility (Ca and Mg hydroxides, Ca and Mg silicates, anorthite, Ca and Mg carbonates) in water and aqueous electrolyte solutions over wide ranges in temperature and pressure were added to the database of experimental data. The complete experimental dataset was then used to simultaneously refine the standard state Gibbs energies of all aqueous ions and complexes in the framework of the revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) equation of state. The thermodynamic properties of the solubility-controlling minerals were accepted from the internally consistent dataset of Holland and Powell (1998; updated Thermocalc dataset ds55). The association equilibria of important hydroxide, chloride, carbonate and silicate complexes were critically reviewed, and their standard state properties and HKF parameters were independently derived from conductance, potentiometric and, in a few cases, solubility measurements. In a global optimization of standard Gibbs energies of aqueous species, performed with the GEMSFITS code (Miron and others, 2015), the association equilibria for aqueous complexes were always maintained. The new thermodynamic dataset reproduces all available fluidmineral phase equilibria and mineral solubility data in the system Ca-Mg-Na-K-Al-Si-","keywords":["Aqueous species","Experimental data evaluation","Fluid-rock interaction","Hydrothermal geochemical modeling","Optimization","Thermodynamic database"]}},

It is based on the accurate EoS for a solvent (H2O) given by Hill (1990) and requires only three empirical parameters to be fitted to experimental data, and these are independent of temperature and pressure. Knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of a pure gas, together with these three parameters, enables prediction of the whole set thermodynamic properties of the solute at infinite dilution (chemical potential, entropy, molar volume, and apparent molar heat capacity) over a wide range of temperatures (0 to 500°C) and pressures (1 to 2000 bars), including the near-critical region. In the cases in which experimental thermodynamic data are lacking, the empirical parameters can be estimated solely from the known standard-state properties of the solute. The new EoS is compatible with the Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers model for aqueous electrolytes, and thus it can be applied to reactions involving minerals, gases, and aqueous ions, in addition to uncharged species."}},

The simple aqueous species density model has been extended to enable speciation calculations and mineral solubility determination involving minerals and aqueous species at high temperatures and pressures. The data set has also been improved by incorporation of many new phase equilibrium constraints, calorimetric studies and new measurements of molar volume, thermal expansion and compressibility. This has led to a significant improvement in the level of agreement with the available experimental phase equilibria, and to greater flexibility in calculation of complex mineral equilibria.

It was carried out during Phase 1 of the Sachplan; starting in 2008, it was completed in 2009 with the implementation of the electronic versions of the PSI/Nagra TDB 12/07. The update is mainly based on the OECD NEA‚Äôs book series on ‚ÄúChemical Thermodynamics‚Äù and has considered the volumes that appeared after publication of the Nagra/PSI TDB 01/01, namely the four volumes concerning the chemical thermodynamics of Ni, Se, Zr, and Th, as well as the update volume on U, Np, Pu, Am and Tc. In addition, thermochemical data for Si compounds and complexes have been the subject of a thorough in-house review. The present report is a supplement to the documentation of the Nagra/PSI TDB 01/01 and replaces the chapters on the data selection for U, Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Tc, Ni, Se, Zr, Th, and Si.

For the present update, special care was given to the description of how the relevant SIT coefficients were obtained and the selected values are all tabulated.

The calculations were carried out using values of the Hückel extended-term parameter for aqueous KOH and dissociation constants for KOH0 generated in the present study. Supercritical solubilities of corundum reported in the literature were regressed with the aid of a speciation model which explicitly provides for the formation in solution of triple ion clusters (Oelkers and Helgeson, 1990). Values of the dissociation constant for KAlO02 generated from these data were subsequently regressed with the revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) equations of state (Tanger and Helgeson, 1988; Shock et al., 1989) to obtain HKF equations of state coefficients and the standard partial molal thermodynamic properties at 25°C and 1 bar of KAlO02., which can be used to calculate the standard partial molal thermodynamic properties of the species at temperatures to 1000°C and pressures to 5 kbar. Combining these parameters and properties with those for AlO-2 (Pokrovskii and Helgeson, 1995) permits calculation to within 0.05 log units of the experimental solubilities of corundum in KOH solutions reported by Barns et al.

Nevertheless, relatively few thermodynamic data other than dissociation constants (K) for a few dozen of these complexes have been determined experimentally at elevated temperatures and pressures. The calculations summarized below are intended to supplement these experimental data by providing interim predictions of the thermodynamic properties of supercritical aqueous metal complexes using the revised HKF (Helgeson et al., 1981) equations of state for aqueous species (Tanger and Helgeson, 1988; Shock et al., 1992) and correlations among equations of state parameters and standard partial molal properties at 25°C and 1 bar (Shock and Helgeson, 1988, 1990; Shock et al., 1989).

The standard partial molal properties computed in this way can then be used to generate corresponding values of ΔS̄0, ΔV̄0, and ΔC̄0Pof association, which for similar complexes correlate linearly with S̄0, V̄0, and C̄0P, respectively, of the constituent cations and ligands at 25°C and 1 bar. Generalizing these correlations and combining them with the equations of state permits prediction of the temperature and pressure dependence of log K and other thermodynamic properties of a large number of aqueous metal complexes. As a consequence, it is possible to retrieve values of log K at 25°C and 1 bar from the results of hydrothermal experiments at higher temperatures and pressures or to predict values of log K at hydrothermal conditions when no experimental data are available at temperatures and pressures above 25°C and 1 bar.

This was achieved by introducing reaction constraints into the parameter optimization that adjust Gibbs energies of complexes by their respective Gibbs energy effects of reaction, whenever the Gibbs energies of reactant species (ions) are changed. The optimized thermodynamic dataset is reported with confidence intervals for all parameters evaluated by Monte Carlo trial calculations.

This heating would have driven hydrothermal circulation at the core-rock/mantle-ocean boundary. We consider the chemical consequences of this hydrothermal reprocessing on Triton's volatile budget by assuming an initial cometary composition for the icy mantle and evaluating the effects of changes in temperature and oxidation state. We assume that the latter would have been controlled by mineral assemblages in the rock. Such reprocessing could explain the lack of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere of Triton and its depletion relative to N 2 and (apparently) CO 2 in the satellite's surface ices. Our calculations also show that whatever the original source of nitrogen in Triton, N 2 and/or NH 3 are likely abundant products of hydrothermal reprocessing. Depending on the temperature and prevailing oxidation state, acetic acid, ethanol, urea, methanol, and ethanamine are possible important components, in addition to ammonia, of the resulting mantle material. Triton may thus preserve the organic chemistry that might have led to the origin of life in early terrestrial hydrothermal systems. © 1993 by Academic Press, Inc."}}
